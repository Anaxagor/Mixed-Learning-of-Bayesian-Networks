This module contains tools for representing linear Gaussian nodes -- those with a continuous linear Gaussian distribution of outcomes and a finite number of linear Gaussian parents -- as class instances with their own *choose* method to choose an outcome for themselves based on parent outcomes.

                          (\mu_0)>,

                          continuous parent outcomes>,
